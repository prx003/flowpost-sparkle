- Expose home stories through one pointer-draggable floating button; keep the position within viewport bounds and distinguish dragging from tapping.
- Keep sample content in an explicit local fixture module, visibly labeled Demo, and never write sample interactions to real accounts.
- Render the floating story control and viewer in body portals so surrounding page elements cannot clip them.
- Keep profile people lists in ConnectionsList and connection actions in ConnectButton; shared query invalidation keeps counts and lists consistent after actions.
- Open profile people lists in a dialog from header controls rather than a section below Highlights, keeping the profile content uninterrupted.
- Keep content creation options (including New Highlight) in the shared CreateMenu, opened from the "New" circle in the own-profile Highlights row; no separate Create button.
- Keep media overlay colors independent of the page theme and use the shared social Button variant for composer actions, so controls stay legible in both appearance modes.
- Keep music selection and preview editing in the shared MusicPicker; stream catalog previews only in the editor and save title/artist through the existing content fields, because preview playback is not a published soundtrack.
- Keep account verification in AccountVerification with account-specific field definitions; never persist identity details or documents locally or claim submission before private storage and review persistence are connected.
- Keep Capacitor Android/iOS projects pointed at the explicit HTTPS published origin with a bundled connection-error page; the TanStack Start app requires hosted SSR and must not be treated as static Vite output. Keep signing secrets outside source control.
